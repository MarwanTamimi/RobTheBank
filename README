# README: Security Vulnerability Analysis of "Rob the Bank" Website

## Overview

This README document describes the approach and methodologies I used to identify and analyze security vulnerabilities on the "Rob the Bank" website as part of the cybersecurity course project.

## Assignment Execution

### Steps Followed

#### Initial Setup:

- Accessed the website using my assigned password to ensure all activities were conducted within the authorized access parameters.

#### Manual Testing:

- Conducted thorough manual testing based on the concepts and techniques learned during lectures. This involved:
  - Input validation checks to identify any vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
  - Authentication checks to ensure that the session and user management were secure.
  - Observation of network traffic for any data leakage or insecure data transmission.

#### Documentation:

- Each identified vulnerability was documented meticulously, including:
  - A description of the vulnerability.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - The potential impact of the vulnerability on the system.
  - Recommendations for mitigating the risks associated with the vulnerability.

## Tools Used

- **Browser Developer Tools**: Used for inspecting HTML elements, modifying DOM, and observing network traffic.
- **Burp Suite**: Utilized for analyzing and manipulating web application traffic, and performing security tests.



## Challenges Faced

- Without the use of automated tools, maintaining the scope of manual testing required careful attention to detail to spot hints of vulnerabilities.

## Learning Outcomes

- Enhanced understanding of how security vulnerabilities can be identified through manual testing.
- Improved skills in documenting technical findings in a clear and structured manner.

## Conclusion

This assignment provided a practical experience in security testing, emphasizing the importance of ethical hacking practices and manual inspection of web applications for security vulnerabilities.
